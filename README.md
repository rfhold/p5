# P5

Pulumi was too long

A TUI application to help you manage your Pulumi stacks.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install p5
```
## Motivation

Pulumi is a great tool, but the CLI is not very user friendly. I wanted to create a TUI application that would make it easier to manage Pulumi stacks and programs.
I also wanted to get a better grasp of async rust and TUI development, so this is a great opportunity to do both. With p5 I should be able to rapidly iterate over
IaC changes while also assisting in complicated sate manipulation.
